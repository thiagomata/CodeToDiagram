\subsection{Detailed Description}
A string is series of characters. Before \hyperlink{namespace_p_h_p}{PHP} 6, a character is the same as a byte.

That is, there are exactly 256 different characters possible. This also implies that \hyperlink{namespace_p_h_p}{PHP} has no native support of Unicode.

See utf8\_\-encode() and utf8\_\-decode() for some basic Unicode functionality.
